# ScamSifter
## a better way to view craigslist housing

ScamSifter is a command line tool that will sift through craigslist housing posts, remove likely scam posts, and send email alerts

Note: Scam Sifter is a personal project, meant for educational purposes only.

Install requirements: 
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

Install ScamSifter: 
```python setup.py install```

In addition to these requirements, ScamSifter requires Google maps and Gmail API tokens
- Google static maps API: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/star
- Gmail API: https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides

## Inputs

two inputs must be specified in parameters.py before running ScamSifter

1. SEARCH_STEMS: a craigslist housing search URL with your desired filters
   - example: https://portland.craigslist.org/search/apa?bundleDuplicates=1&hasPic=1&housing_type=6&maxSqft=2200&max_price=4000&min_bathrooms=2&min_bedrooms=2
2. SCAM_KEYWORDS: a set of keywords used to identify likely scam posts
   - in this example, I used phrases such as 'rent to own' or 'realtor'
   - posts will be removed if they contain *any* of the specified keywords

four inputs must be specified when running ScamSifter

1. a directory to store output files
   - folders created by ScamSifter are PATH/database and PATH/logs
   - ScamSifter looks in PATH/database for a file called ```listing.database.txt``` This is a .txt file containing craigslist listing IDs for listings previously queried. If this file doesn't exist, ScamSifter will create a new one.
   - Without a database file, ScamSifter will search *all* craigslists postings in your specified search query, with a databse file it will only search new postings
2. path to a .txt file with a Google maps API token
3. path to a Gmail API .json credentials file
4. the email address to send email alerts to
   - by deafult, ScamSifter is configured to send emails from the Gmail account configured with the Gmail API credentials

Example usage: ```ScamSifter /PATH/TO/OUTPUT /PATH/TO/MAPS_API /PATH/TO/GMAIL_API/token.json EMAIL_ADDRESS```

## Outputs

ScamSifter will sift through the craigslist search results and send an email titled 'Housing Email Alert'. 
The email contains key facts about the listing, a Google map showing the approximate location, and the first image from the craigslist post

Up to 20 listings will be returned in each email, if more than 20 listings around returned multiple emails will be sent
