four inputs must be specified when running ScamSifter

- a directory to store output files
 - folders created by ScamSifter are PATH/database and PATH/logs
 - ScamSifter looks in PATH/database for a file called ```listing.database.txt``` This is a .txt file containing craigslist listing IDs for listings previously queried. If this file doesn't exist, ScamSifter will create a new one.
 - Without a database file, ScamSifter will search *all* craigslists postings in your specified search query, with a databse file it will only search new postings
